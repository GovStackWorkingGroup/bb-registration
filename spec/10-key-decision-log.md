# 10 Key Decision Log

1. Registration BB and Digital Registries BB is separated into two building blocks. 31.08.2021
2. The UNCTAD’s [eRegistrations ](http://businessfacilitation.org/online-single-windows/)system will be used as a reference system as it fulfills most of the BB requirements. 31.08.2021
3. Additional section “Coverage map” will be added. 05.12.2021
4. “Coverage map” was moved to section 6.3. 05.12.2021
5. Infrastructure capabilities added (9.5). 05.12.2021
6. Review comments incorporated to the main document (see below). Future consideration chapter updated based on reviewers comments. Recommendations not to be considered in this building block documented (see below). 24.02.2022

In that sense, it belongs to the "third parties" if I understood the meaning of this section well.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | <p>Modifications not feasible.</p><p>Interesting thought to validate the uploaded documents signed with electronic signature. The purpose for this chapter was to validate the information filled in by the user (e.g. first name, last name, ID, DoB, etc. ).

| <p>6.</p><p>such generic approach to a data model of the registration process seems to be not very practical. In reality, as terminology section put forward, there are Subject and Applicant, which may have its own complex structure. Omitting Subject and Applicant in the data model put the whole heavy load of modelling of the processing flow and Registry onto users and as such added value of such component seems to be too small. In reality, Subject always has some legal entities and/or persons and/or property/assets. And data attributes are normally attached to some combination of this triad: legal entity, individual and asset. I think, Registration BB and Digital Registries BB should address this complexity. Otherwise it will not be useful for public sector. It will be easier just to ask developer to create using Python or JS/Node just regular code to do processing.</p>                                      | <p>We have chosen the principles of NO-CODE.

Each process has its own data model and the system must be able to facilitate this (all domains). In Mother and Child postpartum use case there is no mention of a company. If such entity will appear, then this can be added to the custom data structure and process by the analyst. System can facilitate any process and user screen. .</p> |
| The requirements mentioned here are quite specific. To cater to these requirements, a new type of no-code development platform may be needed and the existing no-code platforms may not suffice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | <p>As mentioned in the specification there are multiple products selected as reference.

| <p>There are broadly two types of no-code platforms. No-code platforms that facilitate quick front-end development and no-code platforms that enable end-to-end application development.<br><br></p><p>For the first category of no-code development platforms, the starting point is often APIs. They facilitate seamless integration with APIs by citizen developers (analysts) and they also allow rapid development of the front-end based on those APIs.</p><p><br>For the second category of no-code development platforms, the entities along with their APIs (digital registries in our context) are created first, the APIs from those entities are used to build process flows and finally the front-end is also developed based on either the process flows or the APIs.<br><br></p><p>It may be a better idea to check whether the requirements can be aligned with the way the existing no-code development platforms work.</p><p><br></p> | Requirements are envisioned to fulfill the needs of a no-code platform (the second one).
