# 7 Data Structures

The resource model shows the relationship between data objects that are used by this Building Block.

## 7.1 Standards/Protocols

The following standards are applicable to data structures in the registration building block in addition to the general Architecture Requirements:

* QR code must be generated with the ISO/IEC 18004:2015 standard

## 7.2 Resource Model

The resource model provides a basic description of each data object that is used by the Building Block. It also shows the relationship between the data objects.
