# 5 Functional Requirements

These requirements should be sufficient to deliver all functionalities that are listed in the Key Digital Functionalities section. These Functional Requirements do not define specific APIs - they provide specifications and information about any functionalities that must be implemented within the Building Block.

The functionalities described in this chapter apply to any government registration use case. Therefore, they also apply to the following use cases:

1. Postpartum and Infant care- [https://solutions.dial.community/use\_cases/postpartum\_and\_infant\_care](https://solutions.dial.community/use\_cases/postpartum\_and\_infant\_care)
2. Unconditional social cash transfer\
   [https://solutions.dial.community/use\_cases/unconditional\_social\_cash\_transf](https://solutions.dial.community/use\_cases/unconditional\_social\_cash\_transf)

## 5.1 No-Code Development Platform

The no-code development platform is composed of:

* Rules engine ([5.1.1](5-functional-requirements.md#5.1.1-rules-engine-functional-requirements))
* User interface and flow builder  ([5.1.2](5-functional-requirements.md#5.1.2-user-interface-and-flow-builder-functional-requirements))
* Controls configurator  ([5.1.3](5-functional-requirements.md#5.1.3-control-configurators-functional-requirements))

It is used by authorized personnel, called “analysts”, entrusted by the entities in charge of the registrations to develop the corresponding online services.

Pre-requirements:

* The analyst is authenticated and authorized to use the no-code development platform.
* The analyst has a computer/smartphone with an internet connection.

Post-requirements:

* When the no-code development is finished, the analyst publishes the e-service, which becomes available to users (applicants and operators);
* Applicants can submit applications;
* Operators can process the applications.

### 5.1.1 Rules Engine Functional Requirements

The **Rules Engine** is a module where an analyst defines:

1. Who are the **subjects** of the registration
2. For each subject, the **result** of the registration, e.g. a credential
3. For each subject, what are the **requirements** of the registration:
   1. Claims required
   2. Credentials required
   3. Payments/fees required

The rules can be:

* Entered in the rule engine by an analyst, on the basis of the regulations;
* Provided by external rules providers (e.g. rules DBs at ministries level);

When an applicant chooses to apply for both registrations then the system must ask for the passport upload only once.</p><p>One service has two registrations.

### 5.1.2 User Interface and Flow Builder Functional Requirements

The purpose of the **Screen and flow builder** is to define and display the screens, and the fields on each screen, in the application file and processing parts, and to pre-fill or capture the data entered by the users of these screens in:

* The **application file**, where applicants provide claims (= fill a form), credentials (=upload files) and fees (= pay online or upload a payment receipt) and send his/her request to one or more entities in charge of the registration
* The **processing part**, where one or more human or automated (“robot” or “BOT”) operators can review the information (i.e. the data and documents) provided by the applicant, approve or reject an application, send claims to a registry and issue a credential

A container is defined by a name.<br><br></p><p>Fields can be moved to and on the screen by “drag-and-drop, inside/outside of and between containers.<br><br></p><p>In addition to fields, the analyst can create information texts, images that, contrary to fields, do not expect any input from the applicant.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Must have                   |
| SF-3      | <p><strong>Processing part - Creation of screens/roles</strong><br><br></p><p>The processing part relies on the flow builder because roles are part of the process flow.</p><p><br></p><p>An analyst can create one or more screens allowing human operators to process the application files, i.e. to review the information sent by the applicant, to add data or documents to the application file (e.g. a number, a date, a credential, etc.), to approve an application, to reject it or to send it back to the applicant when more information is required.</p><p><br>We call “processing role” (or simply “role”) each successive processing an application file will go through until final approval is given and the registration is completed.</p><p><br>Usually, different roles are ensured by different government entities. It happens that successive roles are ensured by different units in the same entity.</p><p><br>Example flow:</p><ol><li>Unit 1 reviews the application file, checks that all data and documents provided seem true and correct</li><li>Unit 2 approves the application</li><li>Unit 3 issues and signs the credential and sends it to the applicant</li></ol><p>For each role, two screens are necessary:</p><ul><li>A first screen (list screen) where the operator will be able to:</li><li><p></p><ul><li>see a list of application files, filtered by status (pending, validated, rejected, sent back to the applicant)</li><li>select a file for processing (if pending) or for consultation</li></ul></li><li>A second screen (processing screen) where the operator will be able to:</li><li><p></p><ul><li>review the selected application file (data and documents provided by the applicant, fees paid or not)</li><li>add data or documents to the file</li><li>Make decision- approve the file, reject it or send it back to the applicant<br><br></li></ul></li></ul><p>Therefore, an analyst must be able to create one or more roles, each role coming automatically with one list UI and one processing screen UI. Each role will be defined with the following elements:<br><br></p><ul><li>Name of the role</li><li>Name of the registration the role is associated with</li><li>Entity in charge of the role</li><li>Position in the process flow.</li></ul><p>Determinants and groups of determinants created in the rule engine can be assigned to each role.

If the registration subject has more than 2 children, then multiply the social payment times the number of kids.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | <p>Must have</p><p>UC2</p>  |

### 5.1.3 Control Configurator’s Functional Requirements

**Control configurator**, to check if the claims (claims and credentials of registers) are complete and true. This is done through:

* Define if the field is mandatory(required) or optional.
* Add input masks (e.g. only numbers, text , alphanumeric, etc)
* Checks between fields in the screens, web services with external databases, or human revision (by an operator of the entity in charge of the registration)

Pre-requirements:

* User is authenticated and authorized to use this administrative Control Configurator functionality.

## 5.2 Online Registration Services Functional Requirements

The purpose of the online registration services (from here on e-services) module of Registration BB is:

* to enable Applicants to apply for and receive registration claims(certificated documents);
* to enable the Back Office staff, i.e. Operators to process applications, register information and issue registration certificates.

**Example UC: Maternal and Newborn Health USE CASE**\
Sona registers Sowmya in MCTS program. With Sowmya’s consent, Sona registers Sowmya’s child’s name, address and birth certificate, and Sowmya’s name and ID as the caretaker of the child into the MCTS system, which automatically validates the birth certificate and Sowmya’s ID with the government’s citizen records system. Sowmya then creates an account in MCTS for her electronic health records (EHRs) and a barcoded unique ID card for getting further assistance. MCTS connects Sowmya’s mobile phone number to her ID and enables permission for Sona to electronically coordinate various MCTS services for Sowmya.

**User story**

As an Applicant I want to use an e-service, so that I can apply for multiple logically grouped registrations with one integrated service and receive all needed claims/certificates simultaneously.

As an Applicant I want to:

1. go through the filling process and submit an application to receive a registration (certificate);
2. apply for multiple registrations within a single service;
3. monitor the processing status of my application;
4. see the history of all applications submitted by myself.

Pre-requirements:

* User/applicant has access credentials;
* Electricity and internet is available.

Post-requirements:

* Applicants can log in to the system and see available e-services;
* Applicants can select relevant services and apply for a registration(s);
* Applicants can submit applications to relevant entities;
* Applicants can see applications in draft, rejected, validated and sent back for corrections status;
* Entity operators can see list of received applications and process the applications;
* Operators can make decisions (three types) and upload the decisions to the system as results;

#### **5.2.1 API interface for application file registration**

**The purpose of the API interface for application file registration is:**\
****

* to enable an external APP ( Building Blocks) to send application files to e-service without using the default user interface enabled by Registration BB and receive confirmation of the registration.
* to enable an external APP to see the list of e-services and service schema via API.&#x20;
* to enable an external APP to see the list of registered application files in an e-service.&#x20;
* to enable an external APP to update existing application file by using the API.

**Example UC: Maternal and Newborn Health USE CASE**&#x20;

Sona (health care worker) registers Sowmya (Mother) in MCTS program in an offline mobile device. User information is captured in offline mode and saved to mobile device. When Sona arrives to the 3G mobile network the device automatically submits captured information to the Registration BB via API. Application processing is then done as in previous UC.

**User story**&#x20;

As a health care worker (user) I want to use an e-service and capture user data in offline mode so that I can fulfill my duties in remote areas by using my mobile device with APP designed for offline application registration.

As an health care worker I want to:

* go through the data capturing process and submit an application to receive a registration (certificate);
* receive confirmation that the e-service received my application file;
* monitor the processing status of my application, receive update messages;
* see the history of all applications submitted by me.

**Pre-requirements:**&#x20;

* User (health care worker) has access credentials;&#x20;
* User has mobile device with an app/system designed for data capturing in offline mode.&#x20;
* User can log in to the system and see available e-services;&#x20;
* User can select relevant services and apply for a registration(s);

**Post-requirements:**

* When user arrives to the network covered area the app/system automatically submits captured information to the Registration BB where operators process the applications;
* Operators can see list of received applications and process the applications;&#x20;
* Operators can make decisions (three types) and upload the decisions to the system as results;
