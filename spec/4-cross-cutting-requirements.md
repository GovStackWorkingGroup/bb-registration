# 4 Cross-Cutting Requirements

The cross-cutting requirements described in this section are an extension of the cross-cutting requirements defined in the Architecture specification document (here) and Security requirements ([here](https://govstack.gitbook.io/specification/building-blocks/security-requirements)). This section will highlight important requirements or describe any additional cross-cutting requirements that apply to this building block.

**Secure ingress and Egress access mechanisms** (Information Mediator and api gateway) Egress, in the world of networking, implies traffic that exits an entity or a network boundary, while Ingress is traffic that enters the boundary of a network. In the cloud, Ingress means something slightly different. Private networks here refers to resources inside the network boundary of a data center or cloud environment and its IP space is completely under the control of an entity who operates it.

**Inclusion issues** - Multiple languages, assisted model, differently abled people, etc.

The cross-cutting requirements described in this section are an extension of the cross-cutting requirements defined in the [Architecture specification](../architecture-and-nonfunctional-requirements/) and [Security requirements](../security-requirements/). This section will highlight important requirements or describe any additional cross-cutting requirements that apply to this building block.
