# GovStack Building Block Template

This template is intended to be used by the various GovStack building block
repos. Each building block repo will have at least 4 main sections, outlined in
the directory structure below.

## Gitbook and the published "Building Block Specifications" document

Note that pushes to the `main` branch will automatically trigger a Gitbook build
and deployment from the `/spec` directory.

## Repo Structure

```sh
README.md
/spec # the markdown files which are used to build the specification in GitBook
/api # the openapi specification
/test # the test plan and tests
  plan.md
/examples # examples for deploying, configuring, and testing applications which implement the behaviors specified by this building block
  /application-a
    README.md # instructions for deployment/testing
    docker-compose.yaml # example deployment file
      db
      web
      adaptor
      security-server
    Caddyfile # example config for "adaptor"
    Dockerfile # dockerfile to build "adaptor"
  /application-b
  /application-c
```

## Run Cucumber tests

Cucumber-js is used to execute test harness to check compability of application
api with BB test definitions.

### Mock server

Launch the mock server from examples/mock folder. The instruction is located in
'examples/mock' folder in file README.md

## Test data

In order to properly call the tests, a file with input data has been created.

The data must exist in tested software before running the tests.

This data are compatible with the data used in the tests and they are stored in
the `openAPI` folder in the `test-data.json`.

### Cucumber tests

To install project's dependencies, navigate to folder 'test' and execute the
following command:

```
yarn install
```

Then to execute all tests scenarios use the following command:

```
yarn test
```

or

```
npx cucumber-js
```

To execute specific test scenario use the following command:

```
npx cucumber-js features/<file_name>
```

example:

```
npx cucumber-js features/data_update_or_create.feature
```
